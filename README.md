# KC Dev Crew Advent of Code 2023 Competition

## Welcome
In December of 2022 the three of us, [Ben](https://github.com/dangasaur), [Josh](https://github.com/joshpaq), and [Kyle](https://github.com/kheeney), stumbled upon the Advent of Code project. By the end of Decmber, half of our team was working through the daily challenges and Advent of Code was a hot topic at every lunch and happy hour. We discovered that everyone loved the opportunity for experimentation, creativity, and problem solving. Most importantly, Advent of Code gave all developers a shared experience regardless of team, project, or role. 

In 2023 Josh and Ben joined other development teams in KC. This gives us an opportunity to share Advent of Code with more developers and companies across KC. We hope that this shared experience brings you the same joy, comradere, (and sometimes frustration) that it does for us.

## About
The Advent of Code project is a yearly collection of coding puzzles released daily from Dec 1st through the 25th. Each new puzzle includes a short story and description of the problem to solve, as well as a simplified example including sample input and a correct result. Each new puzzle also includes unique input for each participating developer, making all results unique. Developers then create a program to generate their unique result, which is provided to the Advent of Code website. A successful result unlocks a bonus problem for the day. As the days progress the problems get harder. Expect the effort and complexity of the solutions to increase!
